Dear students,
I have received your letter. Over the past year since you were enrolled in the
program, through course study and offering teaching service in underdeveloped
regions, you have enriched your knowledge, broadened your horizon and hardened
the conviction of going down to serve at the grassroots. I am very glad to learn
that. As Beijing Normal University celebrates its 120th anniversary, I would
like to extend my warm congratulations and best wishes to all faculty members,
students and alumni!
Beijing Normal University, as the earliest modern teacher-training institution
of higher learning in China, has cultivated a great number of outstanding
teachers for the country. I hope that you will carry forward the university's
motto "Learn, so as to instruct others; act, to serve as example to all," waste
no time and study hard, cultivate your moral character and improve your
capabilities of teaching students both knowledge and the way of leading a
rewarding life. I also hope that you will serve in places where the country and
people need you the most, and work hard to become a qualified teacher with firm
ideals and beliefs, moral sentiments, solid knowledge and benevolence so as to
commit yourselves to nurturing a new generation of capable young people with
moral grounding, intellectual ability, physical vigor, aesthetic sensibility and
work skills for the socialist cause.
Upon the arrival of Teachers' Day, I would like to wish all teachers across the
country a happy festival!
Xi Jinping
