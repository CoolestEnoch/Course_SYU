## The IPCC - Overview
- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific body established by the United Nations in 1988.
- Its mission is to provide policymakers with objective and up-to-date scientific information on climate change, its impacts, and potential mitigation strategies.

## Main Achievements
1. Assessment Reports:
   - IPCC publishes comprehensive Assessment Reports every few years, summarizing the latest climate science research.
   - These reports are considered the most authoritative source of information on climate change and are widely used by governments and organizations worldwide.
2. Recognition of Human Influence:
   - IPCC has unequivocally established that human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, are the main driver of modern climate change.
   - This recognition has been crucial in shaping international policies and actions to combat climate change.

## Ongoing Projects
1. Special Reports:
   - IPCC periodically releases special reports focusing on specific topics related to climate change.
   - Recent examples include reports on global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius and climate change and land.
2. Sixth Assessment Report (AR6):
   - The ongoing major undertaking is the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) scheduled for completion in 2022.
   - AR6 will provide an updated assessment of climate science, impacts, adaptation, and mitigation options.

## Impacts and Adaptation
- IPCC is actively researching the impacts of climate change on various sectors and regions, including agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, and human health.
- This research helps policymakers understand the risks and develop effective adaptation strategies.

## Mitigation and Pathways
- IPCC assesses various pathways and strategies to mitigate climate change.
- It evaluates the effectiveness of renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon capture and storage, and other mitigation options.
- This information assists policymakers in formulating climate action plans and setting emissions reduction targets.

## Policy Relevance
- The IPCC's work has played a crucial role in shaping international climate agreements such as the Paris Agreement.
- It provides policymakers with scientific guidance and information needed to inspire global climate action.

## Conclusion
- The IPCC's main achievements lie in its authoritative assessment reports and the recognition of human influence on climate change.
- Ongoing projects include special reports, the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), and research on impacts, adaptation, and mitigation.
- The IPCC continues to be a vital scientific body informing global climate policies and actions.
